    <!-- Meet the team, added humor -->

    <section class="about-me">
      <p>My journey as your Digital Business Ally began when I discovered virtual assistant courses. During this
        time, I explored
        many
        software tools for business growth, social media content creation, AI-generated images, and web
        development. My passion for
        marketing and copywriting also led me to dive deep into related resources. This usually ends up with me
        doing a very deep dive of psychological reasoning behind the choices we as humans make.

        <br><br>As a Digital Business Ally, I focus on
        essential areas: relationships, technology, and organization

        <br><br>My mission is to enhance your business and personal life by refining and innovating in these three
        essential areas. I believe that attention to detail makes all the difference in how you present yourself,
        how clients perceive you, and how you feel in your personal relationships
      </p>

      <p>In my free time I love to read and listen to psychology books and personal growth books. Two great books
        I'm currently reading are <b>Subliminal by Leonard Mlodinow</b> and <b>The Born to Win Seminar by Zig
          Ziglar</b>. I also enjoy working on projects, most of the projects I work on have to do with restoring,
        fixing, or renovating but can vary.

        <br><br>I am a proud mother of a 13 year old that has taught me much about how to be patient and learn to
        communicate in a way that everyone feels heard and appreciated even with differing opinions
