          <div class="about-me">
            <p>My journey as your Digital Business Ally began when I discovered virtual assistant courses. During this
              time, I explored
              many
              software tools for business growth, social media content creation, AI-generated images, and web
              development. My passion for
              marketing and copywriting also led me to dive deep into related resources. This usually ends up with me
              doing a very deep dive of psychological reasoning behind the choices we as humans make.

              <br><br>As a Digital Business Ally, I focus on
              essential areas: relationships, technology, and organization

              <br><br>My mission is to enhance your business and personal life by refining and innovating in these three
              essential areas. I believe that attention to detail makes all the difference in how you present yourself,
              how clients perceive you, and how you feel in your personal relationships
            </p>

            <p>In my free time I love to read and listen to psychology books and personal growth books. Two great books
              I'm currently reading are <b>Subliminal by Leonard Mlodinow</b> and <b>The Born to Win Seminar by Zig
                Ziglar</b>. I also enjoy working on projects, most of the projects I work on have to do with restoring,
              fixing, or renovating but can vary.

              <br><br>I am a proud mother of a 13 year old that has taught me much about how to be patient and learn to
              communicate in a way that everyone feels heard and appreciated even with differing opinions
