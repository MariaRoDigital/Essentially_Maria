        <p class="testimonial">"We had a great experience working with Maria as a
          moderator in the Facebook group for our online
          course. She did a fantastic job following our
          guidelines and giving our members a great
          experience.

          <br><br>She helped with community management, including
          welcoming new members, answering questions, and
          providing feedback on homework assignments
          created in the course.

          <br><br>Since working with Maria we have been able to reach
          more of our students, and she has done a great job
          providing valuable feedback that helped our students
          grow and improve. If you want to have a better
          quantity of interactions with your audience without
          sacrificing quality then Maria is the person for the
          job!”

          <p class="testimonial">“Before working with Maria, my business social media
            accounts weren't getting the attention they needed
            and so I wasn't getting much engagement.

            <br><br>She helped with planning and posting content on
            both Instagram and Facebook which relieved a lot of
            stress on me. Maria was also helpful in giving me
            suggestions for solutions to problems I wasn't aware
            of until working with her. Having her manage my
            social media was helpful because it let me turn my
            efforts towards working with clients.

            <br><br>Since working with Maria, I was able to get my brand
            out to more of my audience, orders made increased
            and thanks to that I was able to do my first sell out!”
